Using live imaging approaches, we have identified two novel mechanisms that permit the accurate transmission of chromosomes during cell division. The first mechanism involves the faithful segregation of damaged chromosomes. Our studies reveal that chromosome fragments segregate properly to opposite poles. This poleward motion is mediated through DNA tethers that connect the chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves the coordination of chromosome segregation with cell cleavage. We found that cells can adapt to a four-fold increase in chromatid length by elongating transiently during anaphase. This mechanism ensures the clearance of chromatids from the cleavage plane at the appropriate time during cytokinesis, thus preserving genome integrity.            Activity report          Mitosis is the final stage of the cell cycle where a copy of the duplicated genome condensed into chromosomes is transmitted to each daughter cell. Failure to do so produces daughter cells with an inappropriate genome content, also called aneuploidy. The mechanisms that safeguard cells against aneuploidy are of great interest as aneuploidy contributes to tumorigenesis. Our group has identified two novel mechanisms that permit the accurate transmission of chromosomes during cell division. The first mechanism involves the faithful segregation of damaged chromosomes. The second mechanism coordinates chromosome segregation with cell cleavage.            Mechanism that permits faithful transmission of broken chromosomes          Correct transmission of the genetic material requires proper chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules. The centromere of the chromosome serves as an assembly site for a multi-protein structure called the kinetochore, the functional unit that binds the microtubules. The centromere is, thus, essential for proper chromosome segregation. However, we have recently identified a mechanism by which fragments of broken chromosomes lacking centromeres segregate properly. This is achieved through a novel chromatin conformation that tethers the acentric chromosome fragments to their centric partners. The efficient segregation of the broken chromosome fragments depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint component BubR1. BubR1 localizes on the kinetochore until anaphase onset and accumulates on the “tether”, the chromatin structure that attaches the chromosome fragments, throughout mitosis. To determine how BubR1 recruitment to the “tether” is regulated, we monitored dividing cells expressing BubR1 constructs lacking specific domains. We found that the conserved Bub3-Binding Domain and more specifically the Glutamate 481 (E481) are required for BubR1 localization on the tether. Since E481 is essential for BubR1 interaction with Bub3 and its localization on the kinetochore, we investigated whether Bub3 localizes to the tether and more generally whether the “tether” is an assembly site for other kinetochore proteins (Figure 1). We analysed the localization of five core kinetochore proteins and did not detect any signal on the “tether”. In contrast, Bub3 accumulated on the “tether” throughout mitosis. Bub3 and BubR1 were inter-dependent for their localization on the kinetochore and tether. In addition, we found that Cdc20, a key subunit of the APC/C, was recruited on the “tether” in a BubR1 and Bub3 dependent manner throughout mitosis (Figure 1). The expression of a BubR1 mutant lacking the KEN box, a motif required for Cdc20 binding to BubR1, exhibited severe defects in broken chromosome segregation and was associated with a lack of Cdc20 localization on the tether. To test if BubR1 inhibited locally the APC/C on the “tether”, we constructed a synthetic APC/C substrate. To do so, we fused the N terminal sequence of Cyclin B to GFP::Bub3 (DB-Bub3) and monitored its dynamics in the presence of broken chromosomes. We found that DB-Bub3 persisted on the “tether” during early anaphase in a BubR1 KEN box dependent manner. All together these results favour a model in which Bub3 recruits BubR1 on broken chromosomes, which, in turn, inhibits the APC/C locally by sequestering Cdc20 throughout mitosis. This local APC/C inhibition during anaphase preserves key components important for maintaining the broken fragments tethered.                                Mechanism that coordinates chromosome segregation with cell cleavage          Chromosome segregation must be coordinated with cell division to ensure proper transmission of the genetic material into daughter cells. Our group identified a novel mechanism by which Drosophila neuronal stem cells coordinate chromosome segregation with cell division. Cells adapt to the presence of chromatid arms at the cleavage site by transiently, but dramatically, elongating during anaphase, thus increasing the rate at which the long chromatids clear the cleavage plane. This adaptive elongation depends on myosin activity and the Rho Guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, Pebble. To understand how the cell deforms when chromatids are present at the cleavage plane, we studied the dynamics of myosin during cytokinesis in cells with or without long chromosomes. Surprisingly, halfway through cytokinesis, myosin undergoes flux from the cytokinetic ring and invades the entire cortex. In control cells, myosin efflux is transient, as myosin dissociates from the cortex upon reformation of the nuclear envelope. However, cells with long chromatids exhibit an extended period of myosin efflux associated with a delay in nuclear envelope formation (NEF). During this prolonged myosin efflux, cortical myosin forms extra rings that deform the nascent daughter cells, permitting the clearance of chromatids from the cleavage plane. We have previously shown that adaptive cell elongation depends on Pebble. Consistently myosin does not undergo efflux in pebble mutant cells with or without long chromatids. Since Pebble accumulates in the nucleus at telophase at the time myosin dissociates from the cortex, we hypothesized that the translocation of Pebble into the nucleus induces myosin dissociation from the cortex via the inactivation of RhoA. Consistently, the expression of a pebble mutant lacking a nuclear location signal induces prolonged myosin efflux associated with cell elongation and extensive blebbing, even in the absence of long chromatid arms at the cleavage site. We propose that the coordination between chromatid segregation, myosin efflux and NEF allows adaptive cell elongation to clear chromatid arms from the cleavage plane before the completion of cytokinesis.&nbsp;                                Selected publications    "><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/control-and-dynamics-of-cell-division-dr-anne-royou.html"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/feed.json"><meta property="og:title" content="Control and dynamics of cell division"><meta property="og:image" content="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/pexels-thisisengineering-3861448.jpg"><meta property="og:site_name" content="IECB-Pubii-Template2"><meta property="og:description" content="          Summary          The mechanisms that safeguard cells against aneuploidy are of great interest as aneuploidy contributes to tumorigenesis.

Our group has identified two novel mechanisms that permit the accurate transmission of chromosomes during cell division. The first mechanism involves the faithful segregation of damaged chromosomes. The second mechanism coordinates chromosome segregation with cell cleavage.</p><h2 id="mechanism-that-permits-faithful-transmission-of-broken-chromosomes">Mechanism that permits faithful transmission of broken chromosomes</h2><p>Correct transmission of the genetic material requires proper chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules. The centromere of the chromosome serves as an assembly site for a multi-protein structure called the kinetochore, the functional unit that binds the microtubules. The centromere is, thus, essential for proper chromosome segregation. However, we have recently identified a mechanism by which fragments of broken chromosomes lacking centromeres segregate properly. This is achieved through a novel chromatin conformation that tethers the acentric chromosome fragments to their centric partners. The efficient segregation of the broken chromosome fragments depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint component BubR1. BubR1 localizes on the kinetochore until anaphase onset and accumulates on the “tether”, the chromatin structure that attaches the chromosome fragments, throughout mitosis. To determine how BubR1 recruitment to the “tether” is regulated, we monitored dividing cells expressing BubR1 constructs lacking specific domains. We found that the conserved Bub3-Binding Domain and more specifically the Glutamate 481 (E481) are required for BubR1 localization on the tether. Since E481 is essential for BubR1 interaction with Bub3 and its localization on the kinetochore, we investigated whether Bub3 localizes to the tether and more generally whether the “tether” is an assembly site for other kinetochore proteins (Figure 1). We analysed the localization of five core kinetochore proteins and did not detect any signal on the “tether”. In contrast, Bub3 accumulated on the “tether” throughout mitosis. Bub3 and BubR1 were inter-dependent for their localization on the kinetochore and tether. In addition, we found that Cdc20, a key subunit of the APC/C, was recruited on the “tether” in a BubR1 and Bub3 dependent manner throughout mitosis (Figure 1). The expression of a BubR1 mutant lacking the KEN box, a motif required for Cdc20 binding to BubR1, exhibited severe defects in broken chromosome segregation and was associated with a lack of Cdc20 localization on the tether. To test if BubR1 inhibited locally the APC/C on the “tether”, we constructed a synthetic APC/C substrate. To do so, we fused the N terminal sequence of Cyclin B to GFP::Bub3 (DB-Bub3) and monitored its dynamics in the presence of broken chromosomes. We found that DB-Bub3 persisted on the “tether” during early anaphase in a BubR1 KEN box dependent manner. All together these results favour a model in which Bub3 recruits BubR1 on broken chromosomes, which, in turn, inhibits the APC/C locally by sequestering Cdc20 throughout mitosis. This local APC/C inhibition during anaphase preserves key components important for maintaining the broken fragments tethered.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/pix-royou_fig1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-xs.jpg 300w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-sm.jpg 480w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-md.jpg 768w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-lg.jpg 1024w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-xl.jpg 1360w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig1-2xl.jpg 1600w" height="800" width="1013" alt=""></figure><h2 id="mechanism-that-coordinates-chromosome-segregation-with-cell-cleavage">Mechanism that coordinates chromosome segregation with cell cleavage</h2><p>Chromosome segregation must be coordinated with cell division to ensure proper transmission of the genetic material into daughter cells. Our group identified a novel mechanism by which Drosophila neuronal stem cells coordinate chromosome segregation with cell division. Cells adapt to the presence of chromatid arms at the cleavage site by transiently, but dramatically, elongating during anaphase, thus increasing the rate at which the long chromatids clear the cleavage plane. This adaptive elongation depends on myosin activity and the Rho Guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, Pebble. To understand how the cell deforms when chromatids are present at the cleavage plane, we studied the dynamics of myosin during cytokinesis in cells with or without long chromosomes. Surprisingly, halfway through cytokinesis, myosin undergoes flux from the cytokinetic ring and invades the entire cortex. In control cells, myosin efflux is transient, as myosin dissociates from the cortex upon reformation of the nuclear envelope. However, cells with long chromatids exhibit an extended period of myosin efflux associated with a delay in nuclear envelope formation (NEF). During this prolonged myosin efflux, cortical myosin forms extra rings that deform the nascent daughter cells, permitting the clearance of chromatids from the cleavage plane. We have previously shown that adaptive cell elongation depends on Pebble. Consistently myosin does not undergo efflux in pebble mutant cells with or without long chromatids. Since Pebble accumulates in the nucleus at telophase at the time myosin dissociates from the cortex, we hypothesized that the translocation of Pebble into the nucleus induces myosin dissociation from the cortex via the inactivation of RhoA. Consistently, the expression of a pebble mutant lacking a nuclear location signal induces prolonged myosin efflux associated with cell elongation and extensive blebbing, even in the absence of long chromatid arms at the cleavage site. We propose that the coordination between chromatid segregation, myosin efflux and NEF allows adaptive cell elongation to clear chromatid arms from the cleavage plane before the completion of cytokinesis.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/pix-royou_fig2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-xs.jpg 300w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-sm.jpg 480w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-md.jpg 768w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://iecb-u-bordeaux.github.io/website-publii-cms-repo/media/posts/3/responsive/pix-royou_fig2-2xl.jpg 1600w" height="200" width="454" alt=""></figure><h5 id="selected-publications">Selected publications</h5><hr id="read-more"><ul><li>Derive N*, Landmann C*, Montembault E, Claverie MC, Pierre-Elies P, Goutte-Gattat D, Founounou N, McCusker D and Royou A (2015) Bub3/BubR1-dependent sequestration of Cdc20Fizzy at DNA breaks facilitates the correct segregation of broken chromosomes.
