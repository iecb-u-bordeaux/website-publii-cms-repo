    <title>IECB-Welcome to IECB - IECB-Pubii-Template2 </title>
    <meta name="description" content="Project leader positions at IECB – Bordeaux 2020The European Institute of Chemistry and Biology, Institut Européen de Chimie et Biologie (IECB, www.iecb.u-bordeaux.fr) is a research team incubator placed under the joint authority of the University of Bordeaux, CNRS and INSERM. It benefits from the strong scientific environment of the Bordeaux campus in the Southwest of France. The Institute hosts 16 research groups working at the interface of chemistry and biology in a contemporary building (9700 sq meters), equipped with state-of-the-art instruments and facilities. The scientific policy of the Institute is under the responsibility of an International Scientific Advisory Board, which selects new group leaders.IECB is looking for outstanding candidates who will complement the existing strengths of the Institute, in the broad fields of chemistry (organic, bio-inorganic, supramolecular, biological, bio-inspired nanotechnology,…) and biology (molecular and cellular biology, molecular biophysics, structural biology,…). We are particularly keen to host new teams in the fields of synthetic chemistry and molecular modeling, but applicants from all fields are welcome to apply.Applicants are expected to propose creative projects and will have full autonomy to manage their group. They should also be open to interdisciplinary collaborations with other groups of the Institute and other laboratories of the Bordeaux campus. Successful candidates will have access to IECB’s facilities in structural biology, chemistry, molecular and cellular biology. Candidates are primarily expected to be at an early stage of their research career (with 2-10 years of post-doctoral experience) but more senior applications may be considered as well. The candidates will be asked to apply for start-up funding such as the ATIP-Avenir programme, FRM "amorçage", ANR support or ERC, and will be supported to secure a permanent research position in France if they don’t already hold one. Applicants should be fluent in English. Knowledge of French is not mandatory.Applicants are invited to submit - prior to December 31, 2019 – a cover letter, an extended biosketch explaining the impact of past research (max. 5 pages), a research proposal (max. 5 pages), a separate document with full CV including the publication record (used in a different phase of the selection procedure), and 2-4 references or letters of recommendations to: Dr Rémi FRONZES ( r.fronzes@iecb.u-bordeaux.fr)." />

            <h3>Project leader positions at IECB – Bordeaux 2020</h3>
<p>The European Institute of Chemistry and Biology, <i>Institut Européen de Chimie et Biologie </i>(IECB, www.iecb.u-bordeaux.fr) is a research team incubator placed under the joint authority of the University of Bordeaux, CNRS and INSERM. It benefits from the strong scientific environment of the Bordeaux campus in the Southwest of France. The Institute hosts 16 research groups working at the interface of chemistry and biology in a contemporary building (9700 sq meters), equipped with state-of-the-art instruments and facilities. The scientific policy of the Institute is under the responsibility of an International Scientific Advisory Board, which selects new group leaders.</p>
<p><strong>IECB is looking for outstanding candidates who will complement the existing strengths of the Institute, in the broad fields of chemistry</strong> (organic, bio-inorganic, supramolecular, biological, bio-inspired nanotechnology,…) <strong>and biology</strong> (molecular and cellular biology, molecular biophysics, structural biology,…). We are particularly keen to host new teams in the fields of synthetic chemistry and molecular modeling, but applicants from all fields are welcome to apply.</p>
<p>Applicants are expected to propose creative projects and will have full autonomy to manage their group. They should also be open to interdisciplinary collaborations with other groups of the Institute and other laboratories of the Bordeaux campus. Successful candidates will have access to IECB’s facilities in structural biology, chemistry, molecular and cellular biology. Candidates are primarily expected to be at an early stage of their research career (with 2-10 years of post-doctoral experience) but more senior applications may be considered as well. The candidates will be asked to apply for start-up funding such as the ATIP-Avenir programme, FRM "amorçage", ANR support or ERC, and will be supported to secure a permanent research position in France if they don’t already hold one. Applicants should be fluent in English. Knowledge of French is not mandatory.</p>
<p>Applicants are invited to submit - prior to <strong>December 31, 2019 </strong>– a cover letter, an <strong>extended biosketch</strong> explaining the impact of past research (max. 5 pages), <strong>a research proposal </strong>(max. 5 pages), <strong>a separate document with full CV including the publication record</strong> (used in a different phase of the selection procedure), and 2-4 references or letters of recommendations to: Dr Rémi FRONZES ( <a href="mailto:r.fronzes@iecb.u-bordeaux.fr">r.fronzes@iecb.u-bordeaux.fr</a>).</p>
